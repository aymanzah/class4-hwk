=======================
Continuous integration:
=======================
Continuous integration is a software engineer practice to help making releases easier by committing changes made to the main branch as often are possible (preferably on daily basis). The committed changes can then be validated using automated tests that could run hundreds of tests in a matter of seconds to make sure that all works good and that issues are identified and resolved as soon as possible. This make building a release smoother as a lot of bugs will be resolved early instead of committing a bunch of changes at once.
